My sister lives in Klingenberg am Main, a beautiful part of the world, which not least has excellent wines to offer. With the necessary diversions around Munich, that's just under 400 km flying distance from Unterwössen. That should be doable by glider, if you can only find a weekend when the weather cooperates on both days. The time came at the beginning of August.

The forecast for the Alps is moderate, for the lowlands it is promising, on Sunday even a little better than on Saturday. If I can make it there, I should be able to make it back. Mainbullau, the commercial airfield in the neighbourhood, is unfortunately only conditionally suitable for gliders. A 20-metre-wide runway with lights at the edge is a risky business for an 18-metre glider.

In the other direction, not much further away, is Vielbrunn in the Odenwald. Better call to be sure. Yes, they operate at weekends. It's a pure glider site, but self-launching with the retractable engine is no problem. But there is no hangar space. It's holidays, flying camps, and the place is full. But the euroglide-tested Mike uniform should be able to withstand that.

The weekend approaches, the forecast remains good, the last excuses run out. With the good conditions, 400 km shouldn't be a problem, so I take it easy and don't start until midday.

The thermals are well developed, but the strip between peaks and clouds is still quite narrow. So I take the first leg in the direction of Füssen with restraint. Towards the edge of the Alps the base drops considerably, I fly a line far back in the Karwendel, over the Achensee, and before I know it I'm at the Soierngrat. It pulls reliably as always and sooner than expected the decision is made to _really_ head northwest. The rim mountains south of the Wieskirche go better than usual and clear the way to the flatlands. This time the jump is easy, the next clouds are only a few kilometres to the north.

We pass Memmingen without any problems and reach the Danube valley. Here there is indeed a striking blue hole and the crossing consumes quite a bit of altitude. But the first clouds on the other side of the valley welcome me with a reliable climb.

From now on, it is impossible to follow as fast as the conditions improve. From cloud to cloud, ever better climb values, ever higher base. Already at Schwäbisch-Hall I am at final approach altitude. The sister has followed the flight path in the [live tracking on skylines.aero](https://skylines.aero/tracking) and makes her way to the airfield.

Vielbrunn gives the overnight guest a friendly radio welcome. The forest begins directly at the end of the runway, which is why there is only one landing direction, today definitely with a stiff tailwind. But the runway is long and ascending, no problem to taxi out exactly at the end of the runway.

On the ground, too, the fellow pilots are super-friendly and ready to help, one helper even has a DG800 dolly with him. The Mike uniform is quickly pushed into place. Where the oxygen bottle normally sits, this time the ground anchors have travelled along. According to the weather forecast, tying down is not necessary, but better safe than sorry.

Now the relaxing part begins. On the way from the airfield, we treat ourselves to a short walk in the woods with a spring-water cooled sour schnapps. Also on the terrace at home, the walls of the house have stored the sun of the whole day, Franconian culinary delicacies and a summery chilled Franconian wine await me. Unfortunately, a little restraint is called for, after all, I want to fly home again the next day.

On Sunday, too, the start is planned rather late. So there is time to sleep in and have a hearty breakfast. Nevertheless, we are still a little early at the airfield and have the opportunity to watch the Vielbrunners and their Dutch flying camp guests. The first fluff starts to appear and develops into picture-book cumuli. So once again a heartfelt thank you to family and guest airfield and then the 54hp two-stroke power pushes the MU reliably into the sky. Even the first beard is a surprise - just under 3000 metres of base above a terrain that is itself only 400 metres high. You get the feeling you could fly straight home.

But even on a day like this, the gliding gods put sweat before success. During the night I had still been thinking about taking the route north around Munich for the way back - i.e. over the Steigerwald and the Bavarian Forest. But laziness of thought and the good conditions of the previous day lead me to the same route for the return as for the outward flight. At the beginning it also goes as expected, the base drops steadily, but things are progressing. Around Bad Wörishofen the problems start. The Alps are much better developed than the day before and produce large-scale sinking in the Alpine foothills. A strip from Munich to the edge of the Alps is completely blue. Flying into the mountains seems hopeless, it feels like you would hit the foot of the first hills. To the north, Munich's airspace is in the way. So the only option is to fly into the blue against the wind. Just along the airspace border, the forests and lakeshores give us a little climb here and there. What an arduous end to a day that had begun so magnificently. A small compensation is the view over the city of Munich. One almost forgets to fly because of all the looking to see which toy house belongs where.

At Neubiberg it seems hopeless. It's getting later, the clouds are breaking up in the north, too, and there's nothing but dull, uniform blue on the course. Sure, there is enough fuel in the tank, but such a disappointing end for such a beautiful undertaking...

Maybe the alpine rim will still carry a little in the slope wind, at least you can try how far you can get. So we set off straight towards the entrance to the Inntal, if the corner pillars don't hold, Brannenburg remains as a safe support.

But the flight doesn't even get as far as Sulzberg. Over the Nicklheimer Filzen it suddenly presses in the seat, more clearly than I would ever have dared to hope. Circling in, the climb remains, is effortless to centre. If it only lasts 200 or 300 metres, it's enough to get home. It lasts even longer, the last stretch to Unterwössen is covered with a comfortable altitude reserve.

What remains is:

- Once again the realisation of what an incredible feeling it is to fly "somewhere" in a glider instead of landing in the evening where you started in the morning.
- Gratitude towards family and host airfield, who are willing to support such crazy ideas with some extra effort.
- and a not quite serious, but nevertheless interesting calculation: For a road distance of more than 400 km (one way), two litres of "super unleaded" were consumed, i.e. 0.5 litres per 100 km. Added to this is a land requirement of 20 times 500 metres of unsealed rough grassland compared to 400 km of three-lane asphalt. A glider as autonomous as the DG800 makes the whole thing a quite calculable undertaking (adventures are always nice afterwards, as we all know\...). Perhaps travelling by glider has a future after all in the face of climate change.
