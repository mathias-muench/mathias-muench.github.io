title: Birthday pizza in Salzburg
---
Let's get it straight from the start: It was not a pizzeria, it was a very good and lovely Italian. But first things first...

There is a birthday to celebrate. And for the birthday, a trip to Salzburg is planned, to have dinner at a particularly nice and particularly good Italian restaurant. But there's a catch: the weather forecast is great for flying, and in _this_ weather it would be a shame just to go to Salzburg - on land, as in the Middle Ages. Besides, the birthday boy is a bit aviation-savvy for professional reasons. It should be possible to conjure up something from all these ingredients.

So the plan is: we _fly_ to Salzburg to an Italian restaurant! Hm, there are four of us, only two fit in the Dimona. The flight crosses borders and is in controlled airspace, so we need a flight plan for the mini hop. The departure and destination airfields and the respective residences are spread pretty evenly across eastern Upper Bavaria, and to make it less simple, the whole thing is supposed to be packaged as a surprise.

But luckily Bea had logistics as a subject of study at some point. After a few fully painted newspaper margins, we have a solution where neither people nor cars nor planes get stranded anywhere in the course of the undertaking -- presumably, anyway. Even the surprise thing seems to have worked out. By his own admission, the birthday boy only became suspicious when the wrong people suddenly turned up at the meeting point.

So first thing in the morning we took the Dimona to the vicinity of the birthday boy's home, specifically from Unterwössen to Mühldorf. This is where the first problems in the plan became apparent. While the glider airfield is already bustling at eight in the morning, the commercial airfield does not open its doors until nine. So you can practice the "delay" message for the flight plan. But the weather is exactly as forecast. Dreamlike would be an understatement.

In Mühldorf, first a big hello and best congratulations. But to avoid the next "delay" message, we soon set off. Mühldorf - Salzburg direct would be 15 minutes of flatland flying. That would also be inappropriate neither for the occasion nor for the weather. We take a "little diversions" via Chiemsee, Unterwössen, Zell am See and Hochkönig. We are obviously not the only ones taking advantage of the day. The attempt to open our flight plan by radio fails miserably due to the uninterrupted occupation of Munich FIS. Poor guy who had pulled the shift! But there are two of us, so we simply open by internet.

Our diversions brings us the approach to Salzburg from the south, through the narrow gap of Pass Lueg. A spectacular approach to an international airport. The icing on the cake is that runway 15 is in operation, so there's a loooong counter-approach with the best promenade view of "Salzburg International". The tower crew is friendly and professional, the follow-me beckons us to a place that makes me sigh at first. Sixteen metres span, tail wheel and no single wheel brake. Most people have a hard time parking there. But my doubts quickly give way to undisguised admiration. The attendant guides us to the parking position with centimetre precision. Kudos to the apron staff, a real masterstroke.

Past security ("Are they the ones with the guns?" -- "Excuse me?" No, we're not. They're one behind us, obviously a hunting expedition.), to a coffee and a slice at the bakery stall (The terminal is, Corona-induced, eerily empty.) and then by taxi to Mozartplatz, where we meet up with our country eggs.

Salzburg is preparing for the festival. The city is bustling, as you usually only know it from peacetime. A nice feeling and a short "city stroll back to normality". Then we finally sit at the destination of our dreams, with a view of the Salzburg house facades and a tempting Italian menu. Here we will now stay for the next few hours and let ourselves be pampered.

Towards evening, however, the weather is supposed to become unstable. We have to keep an eye on the rain radar with half an eye. In order not to get into stress, passenger and pilot return to the airport quite early after another short stroll through the city, while our ladies want to enjoy their visit to Salzburg even more. Full professionals that we have become, we handle everything from arrival at the GA terminal to departure on runway 15 as cool as if we also had Ray-Ban sunglasses on our noses and four stripes on our shoulders.

For the way back, we again extend a bit into the mountains. The sight is just too overwhelming to fly past.

In Unterwössen we are well ahead of our escort team. This gives us the opportunity to sit on the clubhouse terrace and chat at length about the never boring subject of "flying". But at least the two of them are there in time for a short sightseeing flight for the birthday wife. The flight takes us from Unterwössen close to the rock face of the Wilder Kaiser and through the wide Inn valley back to Unterwössen. With no landing or other special features, no flight plan or other administration is necessary. If the Salzburg visit gave you a whiff of "great aviation", this short sightseeing flight lets you feel the facet of flying in which a last vestige of "boundless freedom" still lives.

Now the plane is thoroughly cleaned and put away and the evening ends with a good Bavarian dinner at the D'Feldwies inn in Übersee.
