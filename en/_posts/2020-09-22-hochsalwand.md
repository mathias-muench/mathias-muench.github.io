title: Mountain hike to Hochsalwand
published: true
---

Just in time for the start of the holidays, the weather is of course unstable. So we have to make the most of the remaining beautiful days. The Hochsalwand has often been on the agenda, and this time it will be. However, the climb out of the valley is a huge hike, so it would be nice to split it up a bit.

The Breitenberg hut promises that the first 600 metres in altitude and the first hour's walk can be done in the evening. Will an overnight stay in a hut and Corona be compatible? A phone call clarifies things: yes, it is possible to stay overnight. I promise to be there between seven and eight. The half-hour drive from Rosenheim is quick. Only the forgotten corona mask forces a stop at a pharmacy. As easy as the way from the car park to the house should be, of course I still manage to get lost. But the orientation is easy: always steep up the hill.

At the Breitenberghaus itself, it is frighteningly quiet. I had expected that it might not be overcrowded, but I was actually the only guest. The host is Hungarian by birth. The Hungarian goulash is a real recommendation. The typical cottage library promises an enjoyable evening of reading with a trashy novel from the decade before last. I'm in bed by half past eight.

The next morning, I look out of the window with trepidation -- there is no sign of "unsettled". Quite the opposite. In front of me spreads a clear, brightly polished mountain landscape. The breakfast is suitable to lift the mood further. It is delicious and enough for at least two days in the mountains. The ascent begins on a forest road that is being renovated. The ambience is more like construction machinery and piles of gravel. Well, it has to be done sometime. Beyond the Lechneralm, the time of forest roads is over. It's "only" the Bavarian foothills of the Alps, but you can hardly get enough of the view, from grassy flanks filling the picture to impressive towers and rock faces.

From the Lechneralm there is a wild trail over the Lechnerkopf to theHochsalwand. But today the mood is not inclined to experiment, and even on the official path you need your hands here and there, and you also get quite a breather.

The view of the Wendelstein massif from the summit is magnificent. The Wendelstein railway track runs as a thin line under the rock faces. It makes the descent easier and allows a day trip far into the mountains. The descent is comparatively gentle over wide meadow slopes, always with the towering walls of the Wendelstein in view.

When we arrive at the Mitteralm, it is still ten minutes before the next train leaves. A pity, really, as the Almwirtschaft invites you to enjoy a fresh beer on the sunny terrace. But you can also stretch your tired legs on the downhill run. The Gembachau stop, which would be right next to the car park, has unfortunately been out of service for a long time. So I still have half an hour to climb back to St. Margarethen from the valley station. Once there, I make up for the missed refreshment, this time with a wide view over the entrance to the Inn Valley.
